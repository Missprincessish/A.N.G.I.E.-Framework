### Architect of the A.N.G.I.E. Protocol & Guru Kai

I don't just build chatbots; I design **Hierarchical Multi-Agent Systems (HMAS)** that solve for reliability and scale. My work focuses on the intersection of **Autonomous Governance** and **Industrial-Grade AI Orchestration**.

## 🚀 Featured Framework: A.N.G.I.E.
**Agentic Neural Grid for Intelligent Execution**

A.N.G.I.E. is a proprietary orchestration layer designed to manage high-density agent swarms (100+ tools) while maintaining near-zero intent drift. 

### 🛠️ Core Innovations:
* **Tiered Sovereign Cells:** A 1-5-100 hierarchy that isolates context and prevents "Logic Fog."
* **Bi-Axial Ensemble Auditing:** Decoupling Fact-Finding from Tone-Setting via multi-model consensus.
* **Dynamic Inference Optimization:** Smart-triage for compute costs based on task stakes.
* **Immutable Fact Preservation:** Hard-contract logic that locks data layer integrity.

## 📊 System Health & Telemetry
- 🔭 **Currently hardening:** The "Safe-Landing" recursive loop protocols for Guru Kai.
- ⚡ **Focusing on:** Lowering inference latency in triple-model ensemble judges.
- 💬 **Ask me about:** Why "flat" agent systems are doomed to fail at scale.
